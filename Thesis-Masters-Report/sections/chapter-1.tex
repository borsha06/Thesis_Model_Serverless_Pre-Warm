In today's world of cloud computing serverless computing has become quite a phenomenon as it has taken the responsibility of the underlying infrastructure where the applications will run on and the developers can solely focus on the coding aspect. The term serverless has been coined up to portray that the developers do not have to worry about anything related to servers.\\

As serverless has taken away all the managerial aspects from the developers but unfortunately, it comes with specific challenges. Among them, ‘Cold Start’ is a potential problem. Cold Start refers to the idea when a serverless function is invoked for the first time or has remained inactive for a long period and needs some time to be prepared for execution (\cite{MSD+19}, \cite{SA20}) The size of the deployed package and the employed programming languages are a couple of the aspects that have an impact on this issue \cite{MEHW18}\\

In this thesis paper, I will present an overview of the cold start problem in serverless function
 in particular. Further, I will analyze possible problems when running applications on serverless computing platforms by programming my own application \cite{CIM+19}.\\
